# Milk-Minder
Milk Minder is a milk collection Flutter-based app. 


**About:**
- Digitized the traditional milk receipt collection process by developing a solution comprising a Flutter-based mobile
 application. 
- Designed and implemented dual-profile functionality for admin and user. 
- Admin input milk details via form, with data securely stored in Firestore(Firebase). 
- User access receipts generated by admin, fetched in real-time from Firestore. User can also download receipts as pdf to store into their local storage.

**I have different collections in Firestore to store data like - users, admin, receipts, rewards, totals**

**You need to create a project on Firebase and download the .json file.**
- Store in this path: project-name/android/app/'paste here'

**If you want to see how the app looks and work, there is a video of the app in the output folder.**
